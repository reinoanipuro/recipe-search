# Recipe search

I did this project in my elective Haaga-Helia course. It's pretty simple search machine that searches different recipes from google.
For example if you want to find chicken pasta recipe, you just click Kana (chicken) and pasta. After that you hit search button (etsi reseptej√§) and it will do an google search.
First options are what protein source you want. (Meat, chicken, fish or vegan)
Second option is side dish. (Rice, potato or pasta)
If you have special diet like if you are lactose free you can click (laktoositon).
